## We can put reminders or messages here

the format of branches I am thinking is as follows: The top most branch is "main".
below it will be :development
after that for backend I will be maintaing a branch called b_main for main branch just for the backend.
Likewise you can also create a branch falled f_main for the main branch of frontend
